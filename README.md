"A Projection and SensFloor based Augmented Reality Educational Game for Museums"

This game prototype was developed as part of Digital Engineering (DE) project. The purpose of project is to make an educational game for kids who visits museums. The idea was developed after doing few surveys with the museum representatives and gathering requirements from them.

After finalising their specifications, one museum was finalised to work with. Which is Museum of Natural History in Magdeburg, their main idea about game prototype was to show life in the tundra.

The game can be played in editor and as well as when build as Win Desktop application, to work with 2 Projectors (2 Displays).
The input of player can be from SensFloor or from keyboard.

Cheers
